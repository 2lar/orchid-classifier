# orchid-classifier

There are datasets that I have included on local and other places. I cannot upload them to GitHub but they are just sets of what is an orchid
and what is not, like a shark. Each folder is composed of 100s of different images of orchids and sharks and other things that the classifier
will use to depict whether a picture is of an orchid or not.

This is the first classifier and more will be learned. This is "lab 1" of learning AI.

I deleted the orchid and shark folder off the computer because they simply take too much space.
